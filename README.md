# Algo-projects
A couple projects from Fall 2019 CS 383: Algorithm Design &amp; Analysis

Specifically, they are the code my team and I made for a gerrymandering assignment and a Scrabble assignment. For Scrabble, we wrote an artificially intelligent opponent against which a user, or another artificially intelligent player, could play. For gerrymandering, we devised an algorithm to gerrymander a two-party electorate to favor a particular party. Most of the files in this repository are code by the professor, Dr. Peter Drake, necessary for our projects to run.
